# Analysis-of-data-by-dpMIG-seq

On this page, we publish the code for the analysis of data obtained by dpMIG-seq.


## 1. Analysis of the number of polymorphisms between primer sets using tomato



## 2. Analysis of common loci between different primer sets



## 3. Analysis of the sequence to which the primers annealed



## 4. Evaluating the effectiveness of dpMIG-seq in crop species with various genome sizes



## 5. Investigation of the amount of data required for effective application of dpMIG-seq in wheat



## 6. Linkage analysis using segregating populations of rice, tomato, and melon



## 7. Development of a method to apply dpMIG-seq without DNA purification
