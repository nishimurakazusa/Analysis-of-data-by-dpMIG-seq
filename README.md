# Analysis-of-data-by-dpMIG-seq
<br>
On this page, we deposited the code for the analysis of data obtained by dpMIG-seq.
note that Github does not include raw sequence data, 
so sequence data downloaded from SRA must be placed in the rawdata folder for further analysis.


## 1. Performance comparison between dpMIG-seq and MIG-seq
<br>
<br>
This is a script to evaluate the performance of dpMIG-seq using multiple primer sets on tomato material.<br>
<br>
<br>
 
## 2. Performance evaluation of dpMIG-seq on various_crops
<br>
This script compares the performance of MIG-seqy and dpMIG-seq on 11 crop species as material.<br>
<br>

## 3. Investigation of the amount of data required for effective application of dpMIG-seq in wheat
<br>
<br>
Scripts for a more detailed comparison of the performance of MIG-seq and dpMIG-seq in wheat, as well as scripts for a selection of wheat NILs, are included. <br>
<br>
<br>


## 4. Development of a method to apply dpMIG-seq without DNA purification 
<br>
<br>
This script examined DNA extraction methods and enzymes in 1stPCR.<br>
In rice and tomato, mapping rates and number of polymorphisms were tabulated for each method.<br>
<br>
<br>


## 5. Linkage analysis using F2 populations of rice
<br>
<br>
This script performs polymorphism detection, linkage map construction (LEP-MAP3) and QTL analysis (R/qtl) on dpMIG-seq of rice F2 population. <br>
The LEP-MAP3 program must be downloaded from https://sourceforge.net/p/lep-map3/wiki/LM3%20Home/.<br>
<br>
<br>

## 6. Linkage analysis using a F2 populations of tomato
<br>
<br>
This script performs polymorphism detection, linkage map construction (LEP-MAP3) and QTL analysis (R/qtl) on dpMIG-seq of tomato F2 population. <br>
The LEP-MAP3 program must be downloaded from https://sourceforge.net/p/lep-map3/wiki/LM3%20Home/.<br>
<br>
<br>

## 7. Linkage analysis using RILs of soy
<br>
<br>
This script performs polymorphism detection, linkage map construction (LEP-MAP3) and QTL analysis (R/qtl) on dpMIG-seq of soy RILs population. <br>
The LEP-MAP3 program must be downloaded from https://sourceforge.net/p/lep-map3/wiki/LM3%20Home/.<br>
